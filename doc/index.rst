Welcome to MADAM
================

MADAM is a digital asset management library. It aims to facilitate the handling
of image, audio, and video files by helping out with several tasks:

-   **Organization:** MADAM helps you to organize media data by customizable
    backends to read and store media files. Once the files are stored, the
    backend can be queried based on the metadata that is present in the media
    files (e.g. XMP, Exif, â€¦) or based on derived properties such as file size
    or the duration of a sound file.

-   **Processing:** MADAM has a very extensible processing architecture.
    With the various operators offered by MADAM images, for example, can be
    optimized for display on mobile devices by resizing them, converting them
    to a different file format, or sharpening them.
